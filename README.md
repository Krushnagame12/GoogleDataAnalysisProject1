# Google Data Analysis Project
This project demonstrates how Google Trends data can be analyzed using Python and the Pytrends library.
By changing just a single keyword, the same code can be reused to study search trends for different topics.
The project answers five key questions related to keyword search behavior and presents all results using clear visualizations.
